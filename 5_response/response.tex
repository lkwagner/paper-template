We thank the referee for the support and agree with their assessment.


\section*{Response to referee 2} 

\referee{This paper is awful. Here are 15 bullet points why.}
We thank the referee for reading the manuscript carefully. 
We have adjusted the manuscript based on their suggestions and believe we have addressed all comments. 
As a result, the paper is much stronger.

\referee{Point 1: the authors claim that the sky is red.}
We thank the referee for catching the error. The relevant text now reads 
\begin{quotation}
    The sky is blue.
\end{quotation}

\referee{Point 2: the authors mention in passing that dirt is black. When I look at the ground, the dirt is red. Therefore they are incorrect.}
The referee correctly points out that the color of dirt varies by location. In all the work presented here, the dirt was black. We added a note clarifying this point. 
It reads as follows:
\begin{quotation}
    For all tests performed in this paper, the dirt was black, since we are in Illinois.
\end{quotation}
